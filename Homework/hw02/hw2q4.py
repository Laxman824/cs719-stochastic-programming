### Read data from file you choose: commont/uncomment to choose the different files
### This file was generated from a separate python file, using the `cPickle' module
### This is just for convenience -- data can be read in many ways in Python

dfile = open('nd8-4-8.pdat','r')

Fset = cPickle.load(dfile)  # set of facilities (list of strings)
Hset = cPickle.load(dfile)  # set of warehouses (list of strings)
Cset = cPickle.load(dfile)  # set of customers (list of strings)
arcExpCost = cPickle.load(dfile)  # arc expansion costs (dictionary mapping F,H and H,C pairs to floats)
facCap = cPickle.load(dfile)   # facility capacities (dictionary mapping F to floats) 
curArcCap = cPickle.load(dfile)  # current arc capacities (dictionary mapping (i,j) to floats, where either 
                                 # i is facility, j is warehouse, or i is warehouse and j is customer
unmetCost = cPickle.load(dfile)  # penalty for unment customer demands (dicationary mapping C to floats)
demmean = cPickle.load(dfile)  #  mean demand (conditional that it is positive)
demstdev = cPickle.load(dfile)   # stdev of demand (conditional that it is positive)
probnodem = cPickle.load(dfile)  # probability each demand is zero
dfile.close() 


### Define sets of arcs (used as keys to dictionaries)
FHArcs = [(i,j) for i in Fset for j in Hset]  ## arcs from facilities to warehouses
HCArcs = [(i,j) for i in Hset for j in Cset]   ## arcs from warehouses to customers
AllArcs = FHArcs + HCArcs
print AllArcs

### Make them Gurobi tuplelists
FHArcs = tuplelist(FHArcs)
HCArcs = tuplelist(HCArcs)
AllArcs = tuplelist(AllArcs)
