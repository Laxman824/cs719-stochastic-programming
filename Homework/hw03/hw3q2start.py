### Read data from file you choose: commont/uncomment to choose the different files

### Define sets of arcs (used as keys to dictionaries)
FHArcs = [(i,j) for i in Fset for j in Hset]  ## arcs from facilities to warehouses
HCArcs = [(i,j) for i in Hset for j in Cset]   ## arcs from warehouses to customers
AllArcs = FHArcs + HCArcs

### Make them Gurobi tuplelists
FHArcs = tuplelist(FHArcs)
HCArcs = tuplelist(HCArcs)
AllArcs = tuplelist(AllArcs)
